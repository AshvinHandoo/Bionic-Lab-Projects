Summary:
    Part of the astrocyte-alertness-analysis-pipeline. This module was renamed and
    lightly documented for clarity and recruiter readability.

Notes for Reviewers:
    • Original logic preserved; variable naming and comments minimally cleaned.
    • Data paths may be set via CLI args or environment variables.
    • See README for synthetic data demo and end-to-end run instructions.
