# Astrocyte Alertness Analysis Pipeline

> **Repo:** `BIONIC-Lab/astrocyte-alertness-analysis-pipeline`  
> **Author:** Ashvin Handoo  
> **Last Updated:** 2025-10-26

A Python-based analysis pipeline demonstrating a **computational neuroscience** workflow:
- Signal processing for time-series data (pupil diameter ratio, calcium traces)
- Correlation analysis and event-detection patterns
- Modular, well-documented code meant for **data science** roles

## ðŸ”§ Notable Skills Demonstrated

- **Python data science stack:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- **Signal processing:** rolling correlation, derivatives, thresholding
- **Modular code design:** functional separation (I/O, preprocessing, analysis, viz)
- **Reproducibility:** synthetic data + deterministic seeds
- **Documentation:** docstrings, READMEs, and clear folder conventions
